# CampView

## About
CampView is a review platform for campsites and campgrounds. It resembles Yelp or other similar user-generated service review platforms. The user can add a camprground as well as 
edit and delete any campgrounds they have added themselves. Users can also view the directory of campgrounds, leave reviews and view reviews from other users.

Notable features include
- User signup and login.
- Creation of new campgrounds and addition of reviews for existing campgrounds.
- Users can edit or delete campgrounds or reviews they have previously added.
- Image upload as part of creating campgrounds.
- Mapbox integration so users can view campgrounds on an interactive map.

This website is mainly for demonstration purposes and for my own personal development. Therefore the campground names, locations and any information or reviews are not
real. They have been auto-generated using the code and files located in the seeds folder.

The website is deployed and can be accessed here - https://campview.onrender.com/campgrounds
Please allow some time and retry loading if it fails to load immediately. It is hosted using Render's free tier so will need to spin up if it hasn't been accessed recently.
